                            G. Guild System

    You are tasked to create two classes: A Player and a Guild class.

    Project
            __init__.py
            guild.py
            player.py

    The player class should receive a player_name (string) , a hp (int) , and a mp(int) upon initialization.
    The player also has 2 instance attributes: skills (empty dictionary that will contain the skills of each player
    and its mana cost) and a guild set to "Unaffiliated" by default.

    The player class should also have two additional methods:

        - add_skill(skill_name, mana_cost)
            - Adds the skill and the corresponding mana cost ot the dictionary of skills. Returns "Skill {skill_name}
            added to the collection of the player {player_name}"
            - If the skill is already in the colelction, returns "Skill already added"

        - player_info()
            - Returns the player's information, including their skills, in this format:

                        "Name: {player_name}
                        Guild: {guild_name}
                        HP: {h[}
                        MP: {mp}
                        ==={skill_name_1} - {skill_mana_cost}
                        ==={skill_name_2} - {skill_mana_cost}
                        ....
                        ==={skill_name_N} - {skill_mana_cost}"

The Guild class receives a name (string). The Guild should also have one instance attribute players (an empty
list which will contain the players of the guild). The class also has 3 additional methods:

    - assign_player(player: Player)
        o Adds the player to the guild and returns "Welcome player {player_name} to the guild
            {guild_name}". Remember to change the player's guild in the player class.
        o If he is already in the guild, returns "Player {player_name} is already in the guild."
        o If the player is in another guild, returns "Player {player_name} is in another guild."


    - kick_player(player_name: str)
        o Removes the player from the guild and returns "Player {player_name} has been removed
            from the guild.". Remember to change the player's guild in the player class to
              "Unaffiliated".
        o If there is no such player in the guild, returns "Player {player_name} is not in the
            guild."


    - guild_info()
        o Returns the guild's information, including the players in the guild, in the format:
            "Guild: {guild_name}
            {first_player's info}
            -
            {Nplayer's info}"


                Input
player = Player("George", 50, 100)                      Skill Shield Break added to the
print(player.add_skill("Shield Break", 20))             collection of the player George
print(player.player_info())                             Name: George
guild = Guild("UGT")                                    Guild: Unnaffiliated
print(guild.assign_player(player))                      HP: 50
print(guild.guild_info())                               MP: 100
                                                        ===Shield Break - 20

                                                        Welcome player George to the guild UGT
                                                        Guild: UGT
                                                        Name: George
                                                        Guild: UGT
